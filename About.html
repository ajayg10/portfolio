        <h1>About Me</h1>

Hi, I'm Ajay Garg, a 22-year-old Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Cloud Computing. Currently in my 3rd year of B.Tech, I'm passionate about software development, problem-solving, and emerging technologies.

I'm actively working on becoming a Full-Stack Developer, building my expertise step by step in Python, Flask, React, and modern web technologies, while also diving deep into Data Structures and Algorithms (Java) to strengthen my problem-solving skills. Alongside development, I'm preparing for GATE 2026 (CS) with the goal of securing a strong rank.

I believe in combining practical skills with strong fundamentals, which is why I balance my learning between building real-world projects (like auction systems, e-commerce apps, and database-driven applications) and core CS concepts (DSA, DBMS, OS, and Computer Networks).

Beyond academics, I'm focused on self-growth and disciplineâ€”whether it's working on fitness (lean bulk with a mix of fat loss + muscle gain), traveling to new places like Kedarnath and Badrinath for peace and inspiration, or simply exploring how technology can improve everyday life.

My ultimate aim is to secure a high-paying software development role (20+ LPA) within the next year while continuing to grow as a versatile engineer who can contribute meaningfully to impactful projects.

When I'm not coding or studying, you'll probably find me experimenting with waterless skincare solutions for oily skin, brainstorming innovative ideas, or planning my next adventure.
